In John' Green's Book "Antrhopocene in Review", John writes "Sometimes, I need art to
encourage me, as the Mountain Goats famously do in the chorus of
“This Year,” with Darnielle shouting, “I am going to make it through
this year if it kills me.” Other times, I only need art to accompany me."

These two sentences, along with many weeks of battling with the idea of what art is, have finally activated enough motivation in me to want to write it down. To put into words what art is and why it is valuable -- at least in this point of my life. 

# Art is Communication

At its core, art is communication. I don't think that all communication is art, but if you're intending on saying _something_ or listening for a message you may find art along the way. And the importance here is that art is bi-directional. There is no art if there is no speaker/receiver relationship. A speaker must send a message and a receier must listen -- that process is the art. And each message conveys a meaning, a message, a feeling. Art can carry these rich and multi-modal messages unlike text can. 

Humans need to connect with each other. To share our experiences, to comfort each other, to know that we're understood. If text and speech were able to convey our feelings, emotions, state-of-being as easy as art would, we would speak our emotions into existence. But often times, text and speech confines our emotions. A painting, for example, is not confined by grammar and vocabularly. It can communicate so much more. And that is why we use it -- why we've been paiting for at least 35,000 years. 

# Art is Important
As John writes, what he wants out of art is either, but not limited to, an encouraging plea or a validating embrace. And herein lies, I think the importance of art.

Art enables us to communicate more than we could ever with language. And for when we need validation, motivation, or inspiration we can look towards art, filled with rich meaning, deep history, and vibrant emotions. 

Art is important because through it we can become more connected, more understanding, and more loving. Those reasons alone make it valuable, valuable enough to join in on the many conversations happening in an art gallery. 

# Art is...

To me, there is conflict within me regarding whether I am understanding the author's intent or I'm coming to a different message than intended. It could be that I don't have the art literacy to understand the message, or that the artist has failed to communicate their message.
