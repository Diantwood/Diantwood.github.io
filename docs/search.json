And it makes it better because I can incorporate knowledge of Physics and Maths easily while showing of my coding skills too.\nThe main thing I want to put in here is stuff I have learned or I am currently learning. Whether it is machine learning, or it is Japanese culture, I will aim to document stuff here.\nOne thing I want to put on this website, maybe not in the form of a blog post, but is my Honours Thesis. So, stay tuned for that.\nI will also likely put some physics tutorial notes in here.\n\n\n2 日本語を勉強\nテスト\n\n\n3 Testing Plots\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nfig.set_size_inches(12,7)\nx = np.arange(10)\ny = 2.5 * np.sin(x / 20 * np.pi)\nyerr = np.linspace(0.05, 0.2, 10)\n\nplt.errorbar(x, y + 3, yerr=yerr, label='both limits (default)')\nplt.errorbar(x, y + 2, yerr=yerr, uplims=True, label='uplims=True')\nplt.errorbar(x, y + 1, yerr=yerr, uplims=True, lolims=True,\n             label='uplims=True, lolims=True')\n\nupperlimits = [True, False] * 5\nlowerlimits = [False, True] * 5\nplt.errorbar(x, y, yerr=yerr, uplims=upperlimits, lolims=lowerlimits,\n             label='subsets of uplims and lolims')\nplt.xlabel(\"X_axis_title\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Y axis title\")\nplt.legend(loc='lower right')\nplt.show(fig)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Errorbar limit selection\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see from above, the easyness to include plots and Japanese makes it worth documenting all this online for others to see. But it also proverbially kills two birds with one stone.\n\n\nCode\n?plt"
