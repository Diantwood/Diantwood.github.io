    "text": "Reflection\nThose last seven words a very poignant to me. And I think if we looked at my life through this lens, it would make a lot of sense. The first connection I want to make is that these theme of ‘doing Good’ (note the capital G is intentional) is the essence of Lord of the Rings. In it the Hobbits are striving only to do the right (Good) thing. And it so happens that it was thrust upon Frodo and Sam to carry the ring. But it was the Good choice. Those movies tell us that the heroic thing to do is to not give into evil: to do good. And those most capable of that are the hobbits – the wholesome, simple-living hobbits. These are the heroes of that tale. I think both LotR influenced my values and that my values make it why I like LotR.\nAnd the other connection is trying. I vehemently disagree with those who give up. Those who refuse to improve or try or settle for anything less. Those who give into evil. While it is a bit drastic to equate giving up to evil, and it isn’t one-to-one, I think there is nuanced take that not trying is a sin.\nTo all those who earnestly try to do Good: you bow to no one."

    "text": "1 What is to Come?\nIt’s interesting to think that I have learned so much, but I’ve never really demonstrated it or catalogued it. This website will hopefully do that. And it makes it better because I can incorporate knowledge of Physics and Maths easily while showing of my coding skills too.\nThe main thing I want to put in here is stuff I have learned or I am currently learning. Whether it is machine learning, or it is Japanese culture, I will aim to document stuff here.\nOne thing I want to put on this website, maybe not in the form of a blog post, but is my Honours Thesis. So, stay tuned for that.\nI will also likely put some physics tutorial notes in here.\n\n\n2 日本語を勉強\nテスト\n\n\n3 Testing Plots\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nfig.set_size_inches(12,7)\nx = np.arange(10)\ny = 2.5 * np.sin(x / 20 * np.pi)\nyerr = np.linspace(0.05, 0.2, 10)\n\nplt.errorbar(x, y + 3, yerr=yerr, label='both limits (default)')\nplt.errorbar(x, y + 2, yerr=yerr, uplims=True, label='uplims=True')\nplt.errorbar(x, y + 1, yerr=yerr, uplims=True, lolims=True,\n             label='uplims=True, lolims=True')\n\nupperlimits = [True, False] * 5\nlowerlimits = [False, True] * 5\nplt.errorbar(x, y, yerr=yerr, uplims=upperlimits, lolims=lowerlimits,\n             label='subsets of uplims and lolims')\nplt.xlabel(\"X_axis_title\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Y axis title\")\nplt.legend(loc='lower right')\nplt.show(fig)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Errorbar limit selection\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see from above, the easyness to include plots and Japanese makes it worth documenting all this online for others to see. But it also proverbially kills two birds with one stone.\n\n\nCode\nfrom ipyleaflet import Map, Marker\n\ncenter = (52.204793, 360.121558)\n\nm = Map(center=center, zoom=15)\n\nmarker = Marker(location=center, draggable=True)\nm.add_layer(marker);\n\ndisplay(m)\n\n# Now that the marker is on the Map, you can drag it with your mouse,\n# it will automatically update the `marker.location` attribute in Python\n\n# You can also update the marker location from Python, that will update the\n# marker location on the Map:\nmarker.location = (50, 356)\nm"

    "text": "From the Cultural Tutor, this idea came. I think it’ll help with blogging. We’ll……see :)\nSee below the excerpt from the Areopagus Volume XXXV.\n\nIt’s quite simple and good fun. Pick a theme or question. It could be anything at all. Write down your chosen topic. And then, starting afresh each time:\n\nGive yourself ten minutes to write five hundred words about it.\nGive yourself ten minutes to write one hundred words about it.\nFinally, give yourself ten minutes to write ten words about it.\n\nThis is an effective way of whittling down your ideas to what is truly most important about them. Often we’re not sure what we really think, and it’s incredibly hard to figure it out in our heads. Even when we try to write it down our thoughts can spill out over far too many pages and lose coherence. But this exercise is like a formula for getting to the crux of things. It’s also a reminder of how much power just a few carefully selected words can have.\nSo if you’re struggling to figure out what you think about something - whether a personal problem or a political conundrum - or you just want to improve your writing skills, this little exercise may come in handy."

And because I just over-explained, I get the sense that I’ve cut the fat, rather than missing substance.\nThough, I must say that in doing this exercise, it amplifies two things. First, it amplifies that I am very indecisive. I am constantly worried that it isn’t how I actually feel. That there is a better option or feeling that I am missing. Second, it does reinforce part of me does in fact like the being a bit quirky."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In John’ Green’s Book “Antrhopocene in Review”, John writes “Sometimes, I need art to encourage me, as the Mountain Goats famously do in the chorus of “This Year,” with Darnielle shouting, “I am going to make it through this year if it kills me.” Other times, I only need art to accompany me.”\nThese two sentences, along with many weeks of battling with the idea of what art is, have finally activated enough motivation in me to want to write it down. To put into words what art is and why it is valuable – at least in this point of my life.\n\nArt is Communication\nAt its core, art is communication. I don’t think that all communication is art, but if you’re intending on saying something or listening for a message you may find art along the way. And the importance here is that art is bi-directional. There is no art if there is no speaker/receiver relationship. A speaker must send a message and a receier must listen – that process is the art. And each message conveys a meaning, a message, a feeling. Art can carry these rich and multi-modal messages unlike text can.\nHumans need to connect with each other. To share our experiences, to comfort each other, to know that we’re understood. If text and speech were able to convey our feelings, emotions, state-of-being as easy as art would, we would speak our emotions into existence. But often times, text and speech confines our emotions. A painting, for example, is not confined by grammar and vocabularly. It can communicate so much more. And that is why we use it – why we’ve been paiting for at least 35,000 years.\n\n\nArt is Important\nAs John writes, what he wants out of art is either, but not limited to, an encouraging plea or a validating embrace. And herein lies, I think the importance of art.\nArt enables us to communicate more than we could ever with language. And for when we need validation, motivation, or inspiration we can look towards art, filled with rich meaning, deep history, and vibrant emotions.\nArt is important because through it we can become more connected, more understanding, and more loving. Those reasons alone make it valuable, valuable enough to join in on the many conversations happening in an art gallery.\n\n\nArt is…\nTo me, there is conflict within me regarding whether I am understanding the author’s intent or I’m coming to a different message than intended. It could be that I don’t have the art literacy to understand the message, or that the artist has failed to communicate their message."
