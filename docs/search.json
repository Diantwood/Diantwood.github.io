    "text": "1 What is to Come?\nIt’s interesting to think that I have learned so much, but I’ve never really demonstrated it or catalogued it. This website will hopefully do that. And it makes it better because I can incorporate knowledge of Physics and Maths easily while showing of my coding skills too.\nThe main thing I want to put in here is stuff I have learned or I am currently learning. Whether it is machine learning, or it is Japanese culture, I will aim to document stuff here.\nOne thing I want to put on this website, maybe not in the form of a blog post, but is my Honours Thesis. So, stay tuned for that.\nI will also likely put some physics tutorial notes in here.\n\n\n2 日本語を勉強\nテスト\n\n\n3 Testing Plots\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nfig.set_size_inches(12,7)\nx = np.arange(10)\ny = 2.5 * np.sin(x / 20 * np.pi)\nyerr = np.linspace(0.05, 0.2, 10)\n\nplt.errorbar(x, y + 3, yerr=yerr, label='both limits (default)')\nplt.errorbar(x, y + 2, yerr=yerr, uplims=True, label='uplims=True')\nplt.errorbar(x, y + 1, yerr=yerr, uplims=True, lolims=True,\n             label='uplims=True, lolims=True')\n\nupperlimits = [True, False] * 5\nlowerlimits = [False, True] * 5\nplt.errorbar(x, y, yerr=yerr, uplims=upperlimits, lolims=lowerlimits,\n             label='subsets of uplims and lolims')\nplt.xlabel(\"X_axis_title\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Y axis title\")\nplt.legend(loc='lower right')\nplt.show(fig)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Errorbar limit selection\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see from above, the easyness to include plots and Japanese makes it worth documenting all this online for others to see. But it also proverbially kills two birds with one stone."

    "text": "From the Cultural Tutor, this idea came. I think it’ll help with blogging. We’ll……see :)\nSee below the excerpt from the Areopagus Volume XXXV.\n\nIt’s quite simple and good fun. Pick a theme or question. It could be anything at all. Write down your chosen topic. And then, starting afresh each time:\n\nGive yourself ten minutes to write five hundred words about it.\nGive yourself ten minutes to write one hundred words about it.\nFinally, give yourself ten minutes to write ten words about it.\n\nThis is an effective way of whittling down your ideas to what is truly most important about them. Often we’re not sure what we really think, and it’s incredibly hard to figure it out in our heads. Even when we try to write it down our thoughts can spill out over far too many pages and lose coherence. But this exercise is like a formula for getting to the crux of things. It’s also a reminder of how much power just a few carefully selected words can have.\nSo if you’re struggling to figure out what you think about something - whether a personal problem or a political conundrum - or you just want to improve your writing skills, this little exercise may come in handy."

And because I just over-explained, I get the sense that I’ve cut the fat, rather than missing substance.\nThough, I must say that in doing this exercise, it amplifies two things. First, it amplifies that I am very indecisive. I am constantly worried that it isn’t how I actually feel. That there is a better option or feeling that I am missing. Second, it does reinforce part of me does in fact like the being a bit quirky."
