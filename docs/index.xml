  <title>30 minutes, 610 Words: Fulfillment</title>

<p>What makes you fulfilled? This is the question I explore in today’s attempt at 610 words.</p>
<section id="leaning-in" class="level1">
<h1>Leaning in</h1>
<p>A couple of days ago, I wrote a blog that was my attempt at completing a challenge from the Areopagus Volume XXXV. If you want context for it, go to that blog.</p>
<p>There are two things that I want to add before I begin. First is the idea of how fun it is to not only share my attempts, but ask others for their attempts. I think I need more data for this to say anymore than I just like it, but, hey, it might end up as a future 610 words topic.</p>
<p>And secondly is that I partially want to write these challenges with a specific reader in mind. I feel like writing for me versus writing for someone else changes what I want to write about. Again, there is something here about a big part of my life is relationships with others and/or their thoughts/opinions. But also maybe another weeks topic – I am sure all of these personal questions will reveal this.</p>
</section>
<section id="words" class="level1">
<h1>610 Words</h1>
<p>I can’t remember what inspired today’s topic, but my mind is leaning towards a meme – usually all of my yureka moments are from memes. The topic is fulfillment. Again it is broad, but I guess you’ll see my thoughts on the matter. And away we go!</p>

<section id="words-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="words-1">500 Words</h3>
<p>My first thought is that I don’t have all that lofty aspirations. While I do wish to exceed and achieve in life, whether that is leading a company or being a pivotal role in something important, ultimately, I think I lean towards the smaller things in life. Where my mind goes, is to small-scale goals that I didn’t think I’d accomplish. But I want to make a pivot to understand what I find fulfilling, but first asking if there is anything in my life that I have done that has fulfilled me. If I died tomorrow, would I be fulfilled?</p>
<p>If I died tomorrow, I think I would look back upon my life in ambivalence. In one sense, I am proud in the way that I lived my life. I tried in everything that I have done. I sincerely try. I value trying. And I value having fun while doing it. In a sense, I’d say that in trying I have fun. But on the other hand, I would say that I haven’t tried enough. There is more left to do. I’ve spent most of my life gaming. And while, not inherently bad or a waste of time – making friends or as the recent book (Games: Agency as Art) put it: trying on various agency/goals – I think that games aren’t what I value in terms of fulfillment. I’d love to keep on trying my hardest, earnestly and with vigour, on so many more things. Travelling, learning to drive, hands-on activities (construction/housework): these are the first, and certainly not last, things to come to mind. But do I think they will bring me fulfillment? I also don’t think so.</p>
<p>Instead, let’s now look way into the future to when I am on my deathbed. What then will I have wished to have done. I want to have worked hard at whatever job I do. I want to have raised a good family. I want to have been proud to have carried on the Civil name. And herein I think lies something that is interesting.</p>
<p>When I was younger, I had this motto and life goal to be the “Number #1 Person”. It was simple: be the very best person I can be. Healthy (big muscles), very intelligent, emotionally intelligent, generous, and successful. Looking back on it, this attitude is probably the cause for some of my problems. But, anyway, now I think I want to be “the embodiment of a Civil”. Now this obviously needs deconstruction, but to keep things short… but it’s another way of saying being the best version of myself.</p>
<p>So, to connect it all together. I would be fulfilled, both day-to-day fulfillment and retrospection fulfilment, if I was able to live, with passion and sincerity, as a Civil – as myself.</p>
<p>I can see that I’ve danced around the answer to the question. I’ve provided an answer but haven’t expounded. Maybe that is the glory of a few words is that I don’t need to explain.</p>

<p>I am unsure that if I were to live day-to-day being fulfilled, I would end up having lived a fulfilling life. In other words, are the sum of the parts less, equal, or greater than the whole? Part of me answers ‘less’ because there is a chance, I missed the bigger picture. The other part of me says that by nature of living day-to-day means despite the life changes, I ultimately will be proud of my life. And that I couldn’t have asked to live a better life. For now, I’ll declare the latter opinion the winner.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>Those last seven words a very poignant to me. And I think if we looked at my life through this lens, it would make a lot of sense. The first connection I want to make is that these theme of ‘doing Good’ (note the capital G is intentional) is the essence of Lord of the Rings. In it the Hobbits are striving only to do the right (Good) thing. And it so happens that it was thrust upon Frodo and Sam to carry the ring. But it was the Good choice. Those movies tell us that the heroic thing to do is to not give into evil: to do good. And those most capable of that are the hobbits – the wholesome, simple-living hobbits. These are the heroes of that tale. I think both LotR influenced my values and that my values make it why I like LotR.</p>
<p>And the other connection is trying. I vehemently disagree with those who give up. Those who refuse to improve or try or settle for anything less. Those who give into evil. While it is a bit drastic to equate giving up to evil, and it isn’t one-to-one, I think there is nuanced take that not trying is a sin.</p>
<p>To all those who earnestly try to do Good: you bow to no one.</p>

<section id="setting-the-scene" class="level1">
<h1>Setting the Scene</h1>
<p>From the Cultural Tutor, this idea came. I think it’ll help with blogging. We’ll……see :)</p>
<p>See below the excerpt from the Areopagus Volume XXXV.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It’s quite simple and good fun. Pick a theme or question. It could be anything at all. Write down your chosen topic. And then, starting afresh each time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give yourself ten minutes to write five hundred words about it.</li>
<li>Give yourself ten minutes to write one hundred words about it.</li>
<li>Finally, give yourself ten minutes to write ten words about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an effective way of whittling down your ideas to what is truly most important about them. Often we’re not sure what we really think, and it’s incredibly hard to figure it out in our heads. Even when we try to write it down our thoughts can spill out over far too many pages and lose coherence. But this exercise is like a formula for getting to the crux of things. It’s also a reminder of how much power just a few carefully selected words can have.</p>
<p>So if you’re struggling to figure out what you think about something - whether a personal problem or a political conundrum - or you just want to improve your writing skills, this little exercise may come in handy.</p>

<p>Japan… It has been the elusive goal of most of my childhood. Though, I don’t think I ever imagined the circumstances that I would be going to Japan under. Nor, do I think that my goals and wants are the same as when I was kid. I first wanted to go because it was different. It has this allure of technology, anime, city living, and interesting cultural activities. All of the stuff I have now learned, during my times at uni, as what Japan advertises as their ‘Cool Japan’. But now, while I don’t think completely gone, I no longer care for all that. It’s weird, I don’t seem to care for Japan at all. But rather I care for just trying something different. Something overseas. Something away. I am going to Japan as part of an internship to work at Kyushu University as a research assistant to fabricate OLEDs. I’ll be doing that for 2 months and then I’ll be travelling from Fukuoka to Tokyo over the 3 weeks. The first two months, I imagine, would consist of 8-10 hour days fabricating OLEDs Mon-Fri. Weirdly though, I don’t care much for it. I am most excited to gym every morning at the hotel before I start. I am keen to explore the locations around the university and the hotel after my job. I want to look for some hole-in-the-wall that just has either the most absurd food, décor, or cultural difference. And then on the weekend, I hope that I get to travel to different stuff roughly around Fukuoka in Kyushu. Whether that be a tour of a steel factory, or a car factory, or conventions, or night life. I hope to get locals to tell me the cool stuff to do, but also make my own discovery. That is what I hope to get out of those two months. And as you might’ve picked up, it all is just small, innocuous stuff. And for some reason, that fills me with anxiety and dread. Like I am lying to who I am. I’d say I am still holding on to goals and wants of the past. But it’s a tiny tangent – I’ll leave it to another blog entry. When I go travelling with Spencer (after the two months of work), I want to go cruising in a car, explore nature more, try various food – and of course to just find the weirdest and unique experience. To bring this to an abrupt end, I think what I want to get out of Japan is an experience of difference. I of course want to have said that I learned a lot in Japan and research assistant is an unbelievable life experience. But I think I could do without, ya feel?</p>

<p>I want to do all the things I do here in Australia, but in Japan. I want to gym every morning. I want to play basketball. I want the joy of finding and experience a unique hole-in-the-wall. I want to do something left-of-field: something that I wouldn’t expect to happen. Imagine I play basketball seriously in Japan. Maybe that’s what I am aiming for: random, unexpected opportunities. That when I return, I’ll have bountiful stories to share and fondly look back on. I think for the sake of looking grateful, I need to mention that I want to be able to speak Japanese by the end.</p>

<p>I like the exercise. It does help to really sieve out the useless stuff. And because I just over-explained, I get the sense that I’ve cut the fat, rather than missing substance.</p>
<p>Though, I must say that in doing this exercise, it amplifies two things. First, it amplifies that I am very indecisive. I am constantly worried that it isn’t how I actually feel. That there is a better option or feeling that I am missing. Second, it does reinforce part of me does in fact like the being a bit quirky.</p>

<p>It’s interesting to think that I have learned so much, but I’ve never really demonstrated it or catalogued it. This website will hopefully do that. And it makes it better because I can incorporate knowledge of Physics and Maths easily while showing of my coding skills too.</p>
<p>The main thing I want to put in here is stuff I have learned or I am currently learning. Whether it is machine learning, or it is Japanese culture, I will aim to document stuff here.</p>
<p>One thing I want to put on this website, maybe not in the form of a blog post, but is my Honours Thesis. So, stay tuned for that.</p>
<p>I will also likely put some physics tutorial notes in here.</p>
